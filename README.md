These are my dotfiles, my configurations, my shell home I'd like to share.

# Quick Start

To get it up and running, first pull it down into your $HOME:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:achiu/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
```

then you can simply:

```bash
$ script/setup
```

# Configurations

* Fish shell
* Tmux
* Neovim
* asdf

## Tmux

* Sets leader key to `ctrl + a`
* Sets default shell to fish
* configured `reattach-to-user-namespace` for copy-pasta in fish

| Command             | Description                      |
| ------              | -----------                      |
| `ctrl + ac`         | Open a new tmux 'window'         |
| `ctrl + a"`         | Open a new horizontal split pane |
| `ctrl + a%`         | Open a new vertical split pane   |
| `ctrl + aq + <num>` | Switch to a number pane.         |
| `ctrl + az`         | Fullscreen a current split/pane  |

## Neovim

This setups vim to use
[vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) as a base with a
few exceptions:

* sets leader key to `,`
* sets to `nocompatible `
* shows line numbers
* syntax is enabled
* encoding defaults to utf-8
* don't wrap lines
* expands tabs and sets them to two spaces
* show 'invisible' characters
* no swap, no backup, no undofile
* ignores output files like swp, .class, .rbc and much more

### Denite

##### ctrl + o

This switches you into `normal` mode in the panes. This allows you to move around the denite panes using vim motions and action on your selection.

### Dispatch

##### , + d + i

This runs a default set of commands on a certain file type like:

* ruby - `bundle exec ruby -I test <path>`
* rust - `cargo test`

#### Project Diretory Specific commands

Add a `.vimrc.local` to your project specific directory and execute `, + d + i`:

```.vimrc.local
" set a global dispatch
let b:dispatch = 'make'
" for ruby specific projects files in this directory
autocmd FileType ruby let b:dispatch = 'bundle exec rspec %'
```

#### Instance specific dispatch commands

Use `FocusDispatch`:

```vim
:FocusDispatch my/shell/command
```

### vim-plug

Plugins all sit in [nvimrc](nvimrc). Once you've updated the list you can install it with:

```
:PlugInstall
```

Some plugins requires an additional step to leverage neovim:

```
:UpdateRemotePlugins
```
